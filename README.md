# Object-Detection-using-TensorFlow-API
Built a 6 class object detection model using Tensorflow API with Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2-COCO model from TensorFlow's model zoo. Due to the limitation of computing power this project was completed on a Tensorflow CPU version.

Tensorflow object detection repository was downloaded from  https://github.com/tensorflow/models

The TFRecords that serve as input data to the TensorFlow training model. In this uses the xml_to_csv.py and generate_tfrecord.py scripts from Dat Tranâ€™s Raccoon Detector dataset, with some slight modifications to work with my directory structure.

# System Specification 
- Tensorflow: 1.15.0
